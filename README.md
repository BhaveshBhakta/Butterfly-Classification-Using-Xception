# ü¶ã Butterfly Classification Using Xception

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to classify butterfly species using deep learning models, particularly leveraging **Xception** and **EfficientNetB3** architectures. The dataset includes high-resolution images of butterflies from 100 distinct species, sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to build an accurate and efficient multi-class image classifier.
